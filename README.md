# CMPE591
This project is implemented by using MATLAB 2015b software.

1. To simply test the project without any ros dependency one may run the test_script.m file. It automatically loads 6 laser scan and tests them one by one. 

2. In order to run the complete project the ROS with distro Indigo or better is required. The package also uses MATLAB Robotics Toolbox to bind the MATLAB with ROS. However this parts are used only for robot-sensor-computer communication all of the important implementation is given in the test_script.m file.
